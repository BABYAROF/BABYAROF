# What are BABYAROF's goals?

## Anti-swelling structure

BABYAROF token with DIP20 standard is a zero transfer fee token that follows an anti-inflationary structure.

We pay a lot of taxes in our daily life, these taxes are planned for a country's budget without society's intervention and are either out of the cycle or injected into a point of the economic cycle.

BABYAROF tokens have no transfer fees and do not bear any taxes for trading. But in order to convert this asset into notes, it is necessary to first convert it to ICP in the DEX chain and then to Tether in the exchanges.\
BABAROF is an asset that is taxed only when it is converted into a banknote. A significant part of this tax is returned to the capitalists and a part is removed from the trading cycle. In this way, BABYAROF has an anti-inflationary behavior towards its base, which causes the growth of the inherent value of this asset.

### What are BABYAROF's goals?

BABYAROF has grown from scratch as a fully community-driven memecoin on the ICP chain, BABYAROF aims to be used as the backbone of new tokens and create a boundary between its ecosystem and other projects on the ICP blockchain.

> **BABYAROF token is a fully decentralized and anti-inflationary asset backed by ICP, so it can be used as a support for new projects and reduce the liquidity of ICP token.**

### Links with traditional businesses

In the BABYAROF and COE cooperation program, it was revealed that BABYAROF will establish the first traditional business with the help of the COE project plan.

This is a win/win cooperation for both projects because it will increase BABYAROF's financial turnover growth and this financial turnover growth will increase BABYAROF's token burning. (You can understand the structure more precisely in the tokens section)

In the cooperation plan of these two projects, BABYAROF opens a small fast food restaurant and spends 10% of its financial input to create demand for tokens.

The first traditional business called foodcoe has been opened and spends 10% of its financial input every night to buy ICP tokens. At the end of 30 working days, the collected ICP tokens will be used to buy BABYAROF tokens, and these purchased tokens will be presented to their holders in the monthly reward pools.

In this increase in the volume of BABYAROF token transactions, more fees will be deducted, and the bonus amount of BABYAROF token holders will also increase.



> **In this way, the first stream of community-oriented economy will be created to link the market and traditional businesses with the structure of decentralized tokens.**
