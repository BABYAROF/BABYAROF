# What is BABY AROF?

## BABY AROF

An eventful token in the ICP blockchain chain, which in a short period of time was able to grow in a completely community-oriented way and attract the attention of many users.

Today, at the time of writing this white paper, we are actually rewriting it, and before writing the white paper, the project has started its activity.

### What was the reason for rewriting the white paper?

You are allowed to follow the link and read the initial white paper. BABY AROF was a fully community-driven project that was funded and supported by the community, but in early 2023, the development team encountered problems that stopped the project for 21 days. Because part of the project structure was centralized, in the 21 days of the developer's absence, all the issues got out of control, and this caused concern and mistrust in the community. After the return of the developer, the project and the white paper were almost destroyed... the investors withdrew their funds and a significant part of the investors faced losses.

The BABY AROF project was created as a small memecoin with the aim of accelerating the construction and development of the AROF project, but today the AROF project has been removed from the community work schedule and has decided to remain BABY AROF and become fully decentralized.

### BABY AROF is a completely decentralized token

As you read this article today, BABY AROF is a completely decentralized token. BABY AROF is ready to pump again after every wave of supply and demand. BABY AROF burns up to 90%, this token burn can quickly turn BABY AROF into a rare token.
