# Seasonal lotteries

## lotteries

We unveiled a lottery plan in the new development plan with the aim of creating attractive applications and creating a wave of BABY AROF token transactions. In lottery events, a new NFT collection is created every 90 days with a maximum number of 1000 NFTs.

The opportunity to buy lottery event NFTs is 60 days. 5% of the revenue from this collection is the developer's revenue and the remaining 95% of the revenue will be divided between 3 lucky winners in a lottery event.

### Increase the winnings in each event

**Each time, a winner is selected from among the owners of the previous sets and added to the total number of winners. Therefore, in each season of the lottery event, one winner is added to the total number of winners.**

* The first 3 winners lottery event
* Second lottery event 4 winners
* The third lottery event, 5 winners and...

After the lottery NFT sales period ends and the winners are determined, we will purchase BABY AROF tokens with ICPs and distribute the prizes in the form of BABY AROF tokens among the three winners.
