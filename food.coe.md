# FOOD.COE

Establishing a fast food brand using the community-oriented economy plan of the COE project.\
By implementing this cooperation plan, BABYAROF token enters the market and traditional businesses as a practical token and increases its financial income.

### Overview of FOOD.COE

FOOD.COE started from a small shop and big marketing plan. Selling cold sandwiches with a new combination and a new taste. With the first purchase from this fast food, customers have the opportunity to receive 10% of their purchase amount in the form of BABYAROF currency.

In-person customers can learn how to use their gifts properly in the form of a few short training videos.

#### Divide the profit from the sale with the customers

10% of sales will be converted into ICP tokens at the end of each business day. At the end of 30 working days, we will convert all ICPs into BABYAROFs and then we will convert BABYAROFs into COE tokens.

Every month we launch a new reward pool. COE token holders can lock their tokens in the reward pool and receive COE tokens purchased by food coe.

In-person customers learn how to use chain tools and convert their BABYAROF rewards into COE tokens so they can use reward pools and receive a portion of food.coe's profits in the form of deposit interest.

### How does this system work as a win/win?
